## What problem are you trying to solve?

The problem this idea is trying to solve is the difficulty and lack of knowledge many individuals face in properly caring for their indoor and outdoor plants. Many people appreciate the aesthetic and health benefits of having plants but may not have the expertise or time to provide the appropriate care. Consequently, plants often suffer from inadequate watering, incorrect lighting conditions, or improper nutrition. Additionally, some individuals are unaware of the specific needs of different plant species, leading to unintentional neglect or improper care.

## What’s your idea/solution to solve this problem? 

The proposed solution is a mobile application that utilizes smart sensors and data analysis to monitor and provide real-time care instructions for indoor and outdoor plants. The smart sensors, which can be placed in or near the plants, would continuously monitor various parameters such as soil moisture, light levels, temperature, and nutrient levels. This data would then be transmitted to the mobile application. The application, using data analysis and information on different plant species, would provide the user with real-time feedback and care instructions. For example, it might notify the user when a plant needs watering, if it should be moved to a location with different lighting conditions, or if it requires fertilization. Additionally, the application could offer general tips and educational content on plant care.

## Who has this problem? 

This problem is faced by a diverse group of individuals including home gardeners, plant enthusiasts, busy professionals who keep plants in their workspace, and even experienced horticulturists looking for a more efficient way to monitor their plants. Essentially, anyone who owns indoor or outdoor plants and either lacks the knowledge to properly care for them or has a hectic schedule that makes it difficult to consistently monitor and care for their plants can benefit from this solution.

## Why do you think this is a problem worth solving?

Solving this problem is worthwhile for several reasons. Firstly, plants contribute significantly to the quality of life by improving air quality, reducing stress, and enhancing the aesthetics of living spaces. Therefore, assisting individuals in maintaining healthy plants can have positive effects on their well-being. Secondly, there is a growing interest in indoor and outdoor gardening, and providing a tool that makes this hobby more accessible and manageable can foster this interest and enable more people to engage with nature, even in urban settings. Moreover, from an environmental perspective, promoting the health and growth of plants is beneficial for the ecosystem. Lastly, this idea has the potential to tap into a growing market of plant enthusiasts and gardeners, making it a potentially profitable venture while also contributing positively to people’s lives and the environment.
