You need to provide a seed for your idea. 

To see an example, run:

  ./business-model.py --seed-file examples/example1.md

To create your own business model, copy-and-paste the template 
below into a new file, and fill it out.

Then, rewrite the program to generate a business model:

  ./business-model.py --seed-file <your-file>.md

To see more options run:

  ./business-model.py --help
